### Prepare and Deploy to Netify:

Netlify builds, deploys and hosts your front-end.
A powerful serverless platform with an intuitive git-based workflow


`sudo npm i -g netlify-cli`

`netlify.toml`  
[build]  
publish = "build"   
when we run it creates a build folder that is a production build

`netlify init`
-	Give a unique name for site
-	Now project is initialized

Now go to netlify site -> open project  -> Deploy -> Deploy settings -> Environment -> edit variables

We have environment variables on server

`npm run build`  
build folder is generated

`netlify deploy â€“prod`
